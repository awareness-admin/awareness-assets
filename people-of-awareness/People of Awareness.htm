<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><b><span lang=EN-IN>About:      </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span lang=EN-IN>Luigi
Sciambarella is a hypno-psychotherapist and trainer for The Monroe Institute.
Since 2010, Luigi has been teaching and giving talks on meditation, lucid
dreaming and personal development around the world to thousands of people who
are interested in exploring the many different facets of mind (conscious,
unconscious and everything in-between). This has led Luigi to develop a deep
understanding of the waking, dreaming and sleeping mind and the phenomena of
lucid dreaming, out of body experiences, sleep paralysis, insomnia and the
various parasomnias that disturb a good night’s sleep and have debilitating
daytime aftereffects.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><b><span lang=EN-IN>Subject :</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span lang=EN-IN>Dreamwork is a
forgotten art that is often overlooked in contemporary personal development
practice, but which is nonetheless highly effective at generating positive
outcomes and still has much to offer. The intrinsic value of working with one’s
dreams is often understood but overlooked as explorers lack the necessary
confidence and skills in working with their own dream content. The analysis,
understanding and insights available through dreamwork can be further enhanced
by becoming conscious within dreams, through a practice known as ‘lucid
dreaming’. We will begin with a short summary of the current scientific
research and primary benefits of lucid dreaming with regards to how it can be
used for improving most aspects of personal development.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span lang=EN-IN>We will then
discuss how lucid dreaming offers obvious benefits in terms of facilitating
greater self-awareness and insight into one’s issues and solutions on how to
resolve them. We will discuss how lucid dreaming can be likened to mindfulness
practice performed during sleep, and can be used to raise self-awareness,
empathy, compassion and unconditional positive regard towards oneself and
others. We will consider how altering dream perspectives offers a unique
ability which may facilitate greater awareness of life situations, further
enhancing relational psychotherapeutic techniques such as empty chair work and
imagery rehearsal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span lang=EN-IN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span lang=EN-IN>&quot;Children
seldom or never dare to live a happier or more fulfilling life than their
parents. Unconsciously they remain loyal to unspoken family traditions that
work invisibly. Family Constellations are a way of discovering underlying
family bonds and forces that have been carried unconsciously over several
generations.&quot;  - BertoldUlsamer      &nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span lang=EN-IN>A Family
Constellation is a multi dimensional healing process that has the power to
shift generations of suffering and unhappiness. Bert Hellinger, the founder of
this work, who studied and treated families for more than 50 years, observed
that many of us unconsciously &quot;take on&quot; destructive familial patterns
of anxiety, depression, anger, guilt, aloneness, alcoholism and even illness as
a way of &quot;belonging&quot; in our families. Bonded by a deep love, a child
will often sacrifice his own best interests in a vain attempt to ease the
suffering of a parent or other family member.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span lang=EN-IN>Family
Constellations allow us to break these patterns so that we can live healthier,
happier, more fulfilled lives.&nbsp;In a moment of insight, a new life course
can be set in motion. The results can be life-changing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span lang=EN-IN>The talk will
about the Melchizedek method : It's a beautiful way to tap into karmas which
are always at a higher frequency than our gross physical plane. There we tap
... and heal at that frequency by bringing our cells at higher frequency. So we
change thought form of pain and miseries. We are soft and loving
unconditionally always.This results in long term healing as otherwise the pain
returns.All cells with past memories need to be dealt at a speed which aligns
with frequency and speed of the creator of universe. In this modality the
holographic enegy frequency of love in higher dimensions are tapped alongwith
becoming a light body self. Dissolving karmic imprints and raising love light
vibration at all levels greets us all in the hologram of universal love. Let's
walk step by step to our light self.</span></p>

some practices, especially the gamma brainwave entrainment program on remote

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-IN style='font-size:14.0pt'>John Kortum
discovered the human body’s perceptible way of communicating health imbalances
and disease patterns. He didn’t look into the body like an MRI or X-ray and he
didn’t see chakras or auras. Instead he recognized textures within the human
body’s appearance when he looked at people that related to organ health. John
entered university to understand the body’s language but instead found a system
of education unwilling to examine our species’ own biological intelligence. He
departed academic study to cultivate his own perception of health. Without
training, research grants or laboratory technologies, he traveled the globe
correlating the body’s information across populations which led to a coherent
medical vocabulary. In 2001 John introduced our biological consciousness to the
U.S. healthcare system. Observed over sixteen months by a Clinical Professor of
Medicine at George Washington University Medical Center in a private clinical
practice, John evaluated patients who could not communicate their aches, pains,
complaints, symptoms, lifestyles, or health histories. He demonstrated 93%
accuracy for correctly identifying health imbalances by simply looking at
people.</span></p>

we learn about: how the body imprints the brain, recognising stress boundaries,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span lang=EN-IN
style='font-size:14.0pt'>Alexis Brink is the author of &quot;The Art of Jin
Shin &amp; quot; and “Healing at Your Fingertips” and is the President ofJin
Shin Institute in New York City. A practitioner of the Art of Jin Shin since
1991, Alexis is a licensed massage therapist (Swedish Institute, 1991) and
Interfaith Minister (One Spirit Seminary, 2007) and has taught self help
classes and workshops in New York City and different countries for many years.
She has taught Jin Shin in hospitals to nurses and to teachers and their
students in the public school system. She has also written 2 textbooks in the
Art of Jin Shin. Today, Jin Shin Institute, under Alexis's guidance, is
offering a comprehensive curriculum to a new generation of practitioners and
teachers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span lang=EN-IN
style='font-size:14.0pt'>The Art of Jin Shin is a Japanese healing modality, a
dynamic form of energy medicine that focuses on harmonizing one’s life force.
Similar to acupuncture, we use our hands instead of needles. This makes it very
accessible to practice on yourself. When one or more areas in the body become
blocked, energy is unable to flow optimally through the body, and disharmony
can occur. This may result in emotional stress, pain and even “dis”-ease. In
Jin Shin Jyutsu, we apply gentle touch with compassionate awareness to the
energy centers, which are specific locations on the body. By doing so, we can
help release any blockages to promote mental, emotional, physical and spiritual
well being. </span></p>
